# React-and-REST-API

This was the final project for my JavaScript full-stack techdegree with teamtreehouse.com's program. With an API I built in a previous project, I used React to implement the front end and create the final product, which works as a database of classes for a school. This project features user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality using basic authentication and database operations which can be performed by those users. It was built using React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

To run this project, you will need to clone the repository and then open a terminal in both the client and api folders and run "npm start". The site should appear at localhost:3000 if it doesn't open automatically.
